# Staff Profiles

An extension for managing staff listings with contact information.

Update the staff positions via Radiant::Config['staff_profiles.positions'], 
also editable under Settings -> edit configuration in the Radiant Admin

This extension was extracted from a client project so it may need a little tweaking for more generalised use.
